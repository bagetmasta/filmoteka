# Project Description: Fimoteka

The outstanding Fimoteka project will transport you into the world of modern
movies and beyond. Thanks to pagination, you can toggle through movie search
pages and decide what appeals to you.

You can add any movie to your wishlist or just to the queue. On the separate My
Library page, you will find a list of previously selected movies.

We've taken care of your vision, so for those who browse the site in the
evening, there's an option to switch to night mode.

Enjoy our animation and be sure to find some time over the weekend to relax and
watch your favorite movie, a new release, or an immortal classic!
